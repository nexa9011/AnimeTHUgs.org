# AnimeTHugs.org

A clean anime-themed website with enhanced liquid glass effects, dynamic smooth animations (cursor-reactive waves, damped parallax, floating sakura particles, rainbow glow pulses), and cinematic transitions. Site under development — focused on dubbing, community, and watchlists.

## Features
- **Liquid Glass UI**: SVG-based turbulence with cursor-following ripples and multi-layer displacement.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Inertia-damped parallax, drifting particles, morphing waves, and hue-shifting gradients.
- **Responsive**: Mobile-optimized with touch support.
- **Full Screen Support**: Added a "Full Screen" button in the nav to toggle browser full-screen mode for immersive animations.

## Setup
1. Clone/download ZIP.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser.
3. Add your `bg.jpg` (e.g., the rainbow eyes image).
